This is a repor for my capstone project
A key process in SchoolForum  is login, and start sending and receiving messages, chating editing messages. To complete this process, the students will
 first click on a “sign in” button and previously Teacher need to create and account to each member of the forum. After that teacher can choose have
 a private conversation o public conversation. Students can also talk to each other but only in a public mode. The user can also have the option of add
 emoticons to their messages.
After send a message, users can change  to whom they want to send next message, in order to do that,  they  just need to click in main menu button.  
In the right side of the screen  will be also  a board to allow draw some figures, letters, equations etc. 
Board is going to have following buttons: clear, save, colors, thick/line, thin line and brush type.
